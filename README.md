# Variant

Variant is a digital comic reading application for Android tables and iPads.

# Project Roadmap And Vision Statement

The goals of this project are to provide a platform where users can read digital comic books
hosted on any [ComiXed](http://www.comixedproject.org) server instance to which it can connect.

To achieve these goals, the project will:

  * run on Android tablet and iPad devices,
  * maintain a list of servers for retrieving comic books,
  * track from which server a comic was retrieved,
  * allow the reader to set the read state for comics and 
  * sync that state to the originating server,
  * for users who are admins on a server, they will be able to:
    * change the metadata for a comic,
    * set the deleted state for pages,
    * block pages by hash, and
    * mark comics for deletion.
